# Nodes

### 2-nodes

* Traditional nodes store a single object with links to two other nodes (left and right).
* the nodes have 1 data element and 2 links

### 3-nodes

* These nodes have 2 data elements and 3 links

### 4-nodes

* These nodes have 3 data elements and 4 links

The number refers to the number of child nodes (or links)- not the number of data elements contained in a node
