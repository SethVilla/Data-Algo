# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a special tree such that each node has at most two children

* **Full:** a binary tree such that every non leaf has exactly two children and every leaf is in the same level.

Alternate Definition:

* **Full:** a binary tree such that every non-leaf has exactly two children.
  * In other words, each node has either 0 or 2 children.
  * There is no requirements that leaves be on the same level
* The first definition is more stringent
  * if a tree is full by the 1st, its full by the 2nd
  * if a tree is full by the 2nd, it might not be full by the 1st
