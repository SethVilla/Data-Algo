# Paths

* We can determine if there is a path between two vertices with a traversal.
  * Each time you reach a vertex, check if it's the destination

## Shortest Path

* There can be more than one path between vertices.
* We might not want just any path, but the path with the shortest length (the fewest edges).
* We can use a modified breadth-first traversal to find the shortest path
