# Traversals

### Graph Traversal

* Traversals is a way to access the data in a graph.
* Two types of traversals:&#x20;
  * depth-first&#x20;
  * breadth-first

### Origin

* Graph traversals are dependent on the starting vertex - called the origin.
* There is no "root vertex" like in a tree any vertex can be the origin
* the choice of origin affects the order of a traversal
* if a graph is not connected, a traversal might not include all vertices

### Visitation Order

* The order in which you visit vertices is not part of the breadth-first or depth-first algorithm.
* it must be specified but is separate from the algorithm
* we'll use alphabetic order
