# Digraph

* A digraph is graph with directed edges
* Directed edges have a direction from one vertex to another.
* In a digraph, vertex I is adjacent to vertex j (i is j's neighbor) if there is an edge from j to i.

### Connectedness and Digraphs

* a **connected** graph has a **path** to and from every vertex.
* Weakly connected: a path to/from each vertex but only if you ignore the directionality.
* &#x20;Strongly connected: a path to/from each vertex following the directionality of the edges.
* Most often, when discussing correctedness in a digraph, we are referring to strongly connected. But its always best to make sure.
