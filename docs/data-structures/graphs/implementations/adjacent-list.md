# Adjacent List

* Determining whether there is an edge between two vertices requires you to search an entire list
  * O(n) in the worst case
* Finding all neighbors of a vertex means you have to look across the list
  * O(n) in the worst case, but more efficient in an average and best case
* A list is space-efficient, especially for space graphs
