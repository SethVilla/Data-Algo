# Implementation

### Node List implementation

* First node or head is the top of the stack
* Pushes are O(1)
* Pops are O(1)

### Implementing with an Array

* Top of the stack at 0
* Bottom of the stack at 0 (efficient)
* Top of the stack array.length - 1
* Bottom of the stack array.length - 1 (efficient)
