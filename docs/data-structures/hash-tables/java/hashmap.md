# HashMap

* Implements the Map interface.
  * A map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
  * This is essentially Java's hash table class.
* This class allows you to specify what type of object will be the key and what type of object will be the value.
  * You do not have to use an object's hashCode() method - you get to choose what the key is.
  * You specify what type of object will be the Key (K) and what type of object will be the value (V)
