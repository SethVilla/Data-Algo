# Analysis of Algorithims

### Space Complexity

* How much space is required&#x20;



Running time depends on the input

* Best Case
* Worst Case&#x20;
* Average Case

### Theoretical Approach&#x20;

* high level of description of algorithim&#x20;
* make assumptions of the computer model
* can compare algorithms independent of hardware and software environments&#x20;

### Assumptions&#x20;

* Constant time
  * fetch value&#x20;
  * store value&#x20;
  * basic arithmetic
  * call a method
  * pass an argument
  * the time to compute the address of the element of the array is constant

If the size of "a" depends on "n" would not be constant
