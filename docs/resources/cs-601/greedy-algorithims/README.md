# Greedy Algorithims

* Greedy Algorithm fairly easy to describe
* choosing a small locally optimal step that results in a globally optimum step
* It is imperative that we prove that a greedy algorithm results in an optimal solution.
  * Greedy Algorithm stays ahead of any other optimal solution
  * Any optimal solution can be exchanged step by step into a greedy solution
