# Two Pointers

The **two pointers** pattern is a versatile technique used in problem-solving to efficiently traverse or manipulate sequential data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. As the name suggests, it involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions. These pointers dynamically adjust based on specific conditions or criteria, allowing for the efficient exploration of the data and enabling solutions with optimal time and space complexity. Whenever there’s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

The pointers can be used to iterate through the data structure in one or both directions, depending on the problem statement. For example, to identify whether a string is a palindrome, we can use one pointer to iterate the string from the beginning and the other to iterate it from the end.&#x20;

### Does your problem match this pattern? <a href="#does-your-problem-match-this-pattern" id="does-your-problem-match-this-pattern"></a>

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:

* **Linear data structure:** The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
* **Process pairs:** Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
* **Dynamic pointer movement:** Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.

### Real-world problems <a href="#real-world-problems" id="real-world-problems"></a>

Many problems in the real world use the two pointers pattern. Let’s look at an example.

* **Memory management:** The two pointers pattern is vital in memory allocation and deallocation. The memory pool is initialized with two pointers: the _start_ pointer, pointing to the beginning of the available memory block, and the _end_ pointer, indicating the end of the block. When a process or data structure requests memory allocation, the _start_ pointer is moved forward, designating a new memory block for allocation. Conversely, when memory is released (deallocated), the _start_ pointer is shifted backward, marking the deallocated memory as available for future allocations.
