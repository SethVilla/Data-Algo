# Min Cut Max Flow

## Problem

Given a network G = (V, E) with source s and sink t, what is the maximum value of a flow f on this network.

* ### Applications
  * Traffic flow
  * Data flow
  * Supply chain flow
* Its related to matching and assignment problems
* Solutions to the max flow problem broaden our understanding od algorithm design
* It's a foundational question on which additional more complex questions and algorithms have expanded (in many different fields)
